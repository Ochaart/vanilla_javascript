Greetings, <name>
 
Today our team was asked to quickly create a little app for our sales agent call center to use when presenting health plans to our inbound prospects. Our data science team just uncovered a strong correlation between a sales agent who asks the client how their day is with the customer’s weather forecast and the likelihood of closing the sale.
 
For example, just saying “Hi Mrs. Swanson, how are you doing today? Looks like you’re seeing 102 degree weather over there in Lubbock, hope you are staying cool!“ increased the close rate by 177.6%!
 
Our tech lead quickly found these resources we could use to cobble a solution together for a Proof of Concept before leaving on vacation. He said one resource had decent documentation while the other didn’t, but we should be able to figure how the app is working. Here are the two resources he left us.

Weather forecast

Convert USA zip code to lat/long

We could use your help in putting this PoC together. We are here to help too if you get stuck anywhere along the way.
